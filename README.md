# Book-Search-Engine
MERN
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/label-MIT-green)
  ## Description 
  My assignment this week is to set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API. I was given starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and now I must refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. I will then Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API and then I will create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server. The application will be deployed to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.

  ## Installation

  To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

  npm i

  ## Usage

  When the application is cloned, the user will need to run an 'npm i' which will install the node modules for both the client and server sides. Then the user will type 'npm run develop' to start the app on a local server. If visiting the link instead, the user will be presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button. If the user clicks on the Login/Signup menu option, a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up. Now the menu options change to Search for Books, see my saved books, and Logout.
